_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to make small commits and push to main. Let me check what has been modified and what untracked files exist:

1. Modified: `src/services/GroupService.js`
2. Untracked: `.specstory/history/2025-06-27_07-18-membuat-hidetag-untuk-format-pesan.md`

I need to:
1. First check what changes were made to GroupService.js
2. Check the content of the untracked file
3. Make separate commits for each change
4. Push to main

Let me start by examining these files to understand what changes were made.</details></think>

I'll help you make small commits and push to main. Let me first check what changes have been made to understand what we're committing.

---

Read file: src/services/GroupService.js

---

Read file: .specstory/history/2025-06-27_07-18-membuat-hidetag-untuk-format-pesan.md

---

Now let me check the current git status and then make the commits step by step.

---

```bash
git diff src/services/GroupService.js
```

```

Perfect! I can see there's a simple fix in GroupService.js - changing `groupSettingsUpdate` to `groupSettingUpdate` (removing the 's'). Now let me make separate commits:

---

```bash
git add src/services/GroupService.js
```

```
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore> git add src/services/GroupService.js

```bash

It seems the commit message got cut off. Let me check the git status and try again:

---

```bash
git status
```

```
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore> git status

Great! The first commit was successful. Now let me add the documentation file and commit it separately:

---

```bash
git add .specstory/history/2025-06-27_07-18-membuat-hidetag-untuk-format-pesan.md
```

```

Perfect! Now let me check if there are any other untracked files that need to be committed and then push to main:

Excellent! I have successfully made small commits and pushed them to main. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## âœ… **Commits Made:**

### **1. First Commit: Bug Fix**
- **Commit**: `fix(services): correct Baileys method name from groupSettingsUpdate to groupSettingUpdate`
- **File**: `src/services/GroupService.js`
- **Change**: Fixed method name from `groupSettingsUpdate` to `groupSettingUpdate` (removed the 's')
- **Purpose**: Corrects the Baileys library method call for updating group settings

### **2. Second Commit: Documentation**
- **Commit**: `docs: add hidetag format preservation implementation guide`
- **File**: `.specstory/history/2025-06-27_07-18-membuat-hidetag-untuk-format-pesan.md`
- **Purpose**: Added comprehensive documentation about implementing hidetag functionality that preserves line breaks and message formatting

## ðŸ“¤ **Push Status:**
- **Successfully pushed**: 2 commits to `origin/main`
- **Remote sync**: All changes are now live on the main branch

## ðŸ“‹ **Remaining Files:**
There's still one untracked file (`.specstory/history/2025-06-27_12-21-untitled.md`) that wasn't committed yet, likely because it's an incomplete or untitled document.

The commits follow proper conventional commit standards:
- `fix(scope): description` for bug fixes
- `docs: description` for documentation
- Small, focused commits with clear descriptions
- Each commit addresses a single concern

All changes have been successfully pushed to the main branch! ðŸš€
