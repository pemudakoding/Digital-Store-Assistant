# Creating and organizing commits (2025-07-01 16:11Z)

_**User**_

please do commits

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you with creating commits for your changes. Let me think about this sequentially:

1. First, I need to check if there are any uncommitted changes in the repository
2. Then I can help organize and create meaningful commits following the project's conventional commit standards

Let me check for any changes first:

---

```bash
git status
```

```
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore> git status
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore> git status



























On branch main



PS D:\projects\KoalaStore>
```

---

I notice that there are no changes to commit at the moment. The `git status` output shows that we're on the `main` branch and there are no uncommitted changes.

Would you like me to:
1. Check if there are any untracked files that might need to be added?
2. Help you make some changes that we can then commit?
3. Show you how to make commits following the project's commit standards?

Please let me know what you'd like to do next!

_**User**_

please do small commits

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand you want to make small commits, but I need to check what changes are available to commit. Let me look more thoroughly at the repository status:

---

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

```
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore> git status --porcelain
PS D:\projects\KoalaStore>

```
