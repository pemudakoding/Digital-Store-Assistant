# Process messages from my number (2025-06-30 06:48Z)

_**User**_

please make if it from me then process any message

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you modify the code to process messages from your own number. I'll analyze this step by step.

1. First, let me understand what we're working with:
- The code is in `MessageHandler.js` and currently blocks messages from the bot itself
- You want to process messages if they come from your number specifically

2. To implement this, we'll need to:
- Keep the bot message prevention
- Add a condition to allow your number to be processed
- Make sure we don't break existing functionality

Let me modify the code:

---

```diff
              // Prevent bot from processing its own messages
              const botId = this.client.user?.id?.split(":")[0] + "@s.whatsapp.net";
-             if (context.sender === botId) {
+             const ownerNumber = "6285761211328@s.whatsapp.net"; // Based on the image file name in gambar/
+             if (context.sender === botId && context.sender !== ownerNumber) {
                  logger.debug(`Ignoring self-message from bot: ${context.sender}`);
                  return;
```

---

Let me explain the changes I made:

1. I kept the existing `botId` detection to prevent the bot from processing its own messages
2. I added your number (which I got from the `gambar/6285761211328.jpg` file in the project structure) as `ownerNumber`
3. Modified the condition to only ignore messages if:
   - The sender is the bot ID AND
   - The sender is not your number

This means that:
- The bot will still ignore its own messages (preventing potential loops)
- Messages from your number will be processed
- Messages from other users will continue to work normally

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation? For example, we could:
1. Move the owner number to a configuration file
2. Add more owner numbers if needed
3. Make any other modifications to the message processing logic

Please let me know if you want any changes or if this meets your requirements!
