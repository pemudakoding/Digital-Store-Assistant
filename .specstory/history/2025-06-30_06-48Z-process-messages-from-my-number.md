# Process messages from my number (2025-06-30 06:48Z)

_**User**_

please make if it from me then process any message

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you modify the code to process messages from your own number. I'll analyze this step by step.

1. First, let me understand what we're working with:
- The code is in `MessageHandler.js` and currently blocks messages from the bot itself
- You want to process messages if they come from your number specifically

2. To implement this, we'll need to:
- Keep the bot message prevention
- Add a condition to allow your number to be processed
- Make sure we don't break existing functionality

Let me modify the code:

Let me explain the changes I made:

1. I kept the existing `botId` detection to prevent the bot from processing its own messages
2. I added your number (which I got from the `gambar/6285761211328.jpg` file in the project structure) as `ownerNumber`
3. Modified the condition to only ignore messages if:
   - The sender is the bot ID AND
   - The sender is not your number

This means that:
- The bot will still ignore its own messages (preventing potential loops)
- Messages from your number will be processed
- Messages from other users will continue to work normally

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation? For example, we could:
1. Move the owner number to a configuration file
2. Add more owner numbers if needed
3. Make any other modifications to the message processing logic

Please let me know if you want any changes or if this meets your requirements!

i mean from.me attribute on baileys which is indicate send by bot number

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I apologize for the misunderstanding! Now I understand - you want to process messages that have the `fromMe` attribute from Baileys, which indicates messages sent by the bot's number. Let me search for the relevant code first.

I see that the message handling is done in `MessageHandler.js`. Currently, it's blocking messages from the bot's own number. Let me modify this to process messages when they have the `fromMe` attribute set to true.

---

```diff
              const context = await this.createContext(msg);
              
-             // Prevent bot from processing its own messages
-             const botId = this.client.user?.id?.split(":")[0] + "@s.whatsapp.net";
-             if (context.sender === botId) {
+             // Process messages from bot if they are sent by us
+             if (msg.key.fromMe) {
+                 logger.debug(`Processing self-message from bot: ${context.sender}`);
+             }
+             // Otherwise prevent bot from processing its own messages
+             else if (context.sender === botId) {
                  logger.debug(`Ignoring self-message from bot: ${context.sender}`);
                  return;
```

---

I've modified the code to:

1. Check if the message has `msg.key.fromMe = true`, which indicates it was sent by the bot's number
2. If it is from the bot's number, process the message and log it
3. If it's not from the bot's number but matches the bot's ID, ignore it (this prevents processing messages from other instances of the bot)

This change means that:
- Messages you send using the bot's number will be processed
- Messages from other instances of the bot will still be ignored
- Messages from other users will continue to work normally

The change uses the Baileys `fromMe` attribute which is the proper way to detect messages sent by the bot's number, as you mentioned.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

_**User**_

please do small commits

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for making too many changes at once. You're right - let's make smaller, focused commits. Let me break this down into smaller steps.

Step 1 - Let's first just add the `fromMe` check:

---

```diff
              const context = await this.createContext(msg);
              
-             // Process messages from bot if they are sent by us
-             if (msg.key.fromMe) {
+             // Prevent bot from processing its own messages
+             const botId = this.client.user?.id?.split(":")[0] + "@s.whatsapp.net";
+             if (context.sender === botId && !msg.key.fromMe) {
                  logger.debug(`Ignoring self-message from bot: ${context.sender}`);
- 
                  return;
              }
```

---

This small change:
1. Keeps the existing bot ID check
2. Only ignores messages if they are from the bot ID AND not sent by us (`!msg.key.fromMe`)
3. Maintains the same logging message

This way we're making a minimal change that allows messages from the bot when they have `fromMe=true` while still preventing processing of messages from other bot instances.

Would you like me to proceed with any other small changes, or is this change sufficient for your needs?
