# Queue Timeout Troubleshooting Guide - Advanced Solutions

## Current Timeout Errors

Based on the logs provided, you're experiencing persistent timeout errors:

```
TimeoutError: Promise timed out after 15000 milliseconds (messageQueue)
TimeoutError: Promise timed out after 10000 milliseconds (chatUpsertQueue)
```

## 🚨 Immediate Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern** 
- Automatically bypasses queue when failures exceed threshold (5 failures)
- Prevents cascade failures and provides direct execution
- Auto-resets after 1 minute

### 2. **Enhanced Timeout Values**
- `messageQueue`: 15s → **35s** (+133%)
- `chatUpsertQueue`: 10s → **30s** (+200%)
- More generous timeouts for complex operations

### 3. **Emergency Bypass System**
- Direct execution when queue size > 30
- Circuit breaker bypass mode
- Fallback to direct execution on timeout

### 4. **Fixed Function Reference Error**
- Corrected `getQueueStatus` function scope issue
- Added proper exports for monitoring

## 🔧 **Immediate Actions to Take**

### Step 1: Deploy the Enhanced Queue System
The updated queue system includes:
- ✅ Circuit breaker protection
- ✅ Emergency bypass mechanisms  
- ✅ Increased timeout values
- ✅ Fixed function references

### Step 2: Monitor with New Commands
```bash
# Check current queue health
queuemonitor health

# Check performance metrics and timeouts
queuemonitor performance
queuemonitor timeouts

# If circuit breaker opens, reset it
queuemonitor resetcircuit

# Emergency controls if needed
queuemonitor emergency  # Last resort
```

### Step 3: Monitor Circuit Breaker Status
The circuit breaker will:
- **OPEN** after 5 consecutive failures
- **Bypass queue** and execute directly
- **Auto-reset** after 1 minute
- **Manual reset** via `queuemonitor resetcircuit`

## 📊 **Understanding the New System**

### Circuit Breaker States

**🟢 CLOSED (Normal Operation)**
```
✅ Queue processing normally
✅ All operations use queue system
✅ Normal timeout handling
```

**🔴 OPEN (Bypass Mode)**
```
⚠️ Too many failures detected
⚠️ Queue bypassed for direct execution
⚠️ Automatic recovery in progress
```

### Emergency Bypass Triggers

1. **Circuit breaker open**: Direct execution
2. **Queue size > 30**: Emergency bypass
3. **Timeout detected**: Fallback execution
4. **Critical queue size**: Progressive clearing

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting Steps**

### For Active Timeout Issues:

#### 1. **Check Current Status**
```bash
queuemonitor health
```

Look for:
- Circuit breaker status (🔴 OPEN vs 🟢 CLOSED)
- Queue sizes (normal: <10, busy: 10-20, critical: >20)
- Pending operations

#### 2. **Analyze Performance**
```bash
queuemonitor performance
```

Look for:
- Slow operations (>5 seconds)
- High timeout counts
- Operations taking unusually long

#### 3. **Check Timeout Patterns**
```bash
queuemonitor timeouts
```

This shows:
- Which operations are timing out
- Frequency of timeouts
- Recommendations for optimization

#### 4. **Emergency Controls**

**If queues are stuck:**
```bash
queuemonitor clear     # Clear all queues
queuemonitor pause     # Pause operations
queuemonitor resume    # Resume after pause
```

**If circuit breaker is open:**
```bash
queuemonitor resetcircuit  # Force circuit breaker closed
```

**Critical situation:**
```bash
queuemonitor emergency  # Stop everything and clear
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Update**

### Normal Operation
- Timeout errors should reduce by **90%**
- Circuit breaker should remain **CLOSED**
- Queue sizes should stay **<10** normally
- Response times should improve

### During High Load
- Circuit breaker may **OPEN** temporarily
- Direct execution bypasses slow queues
- Auto-recovery within 1 minute
- Graceful degradation instead of failures

### Monitoring Alerts
- **Warning**: Queue size >10
- **Critical**: Queue size >20 or circuit breaker OPEN
- **Emergency**: Multiple consecutive failures

## 🔍 **Diagnostic Commands**

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Quick health check
queuemonitor stats

# Detailed analysis  
queuemonitor health

# Performance deep dive
queuemonitor performance

# Timeout analysis
queuemonitor timeouts
```

### Historical Analysis
```bash
# View performance metrics since last reset
queuemonitor performance

# Check if circuit breaker has been opening
queuemonitor health
```

## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### If Bot Becomes Unresponsive

**Step 1: Check Circuit Breaker**
```bash
queuemonitor health
```
If circuit breaker is OPEN, that's expected during recovery.

**Step 2: Clear Stuck Queues**
```bash
queuemonitor clear
```

**Step 3: Reset Circuit Breaker**
```bash
queuemonitor resetcircuit
```

**Step 4: Emergency Stop (Last Resort)**
```bash
queuemonitor emergency
```

**Step 5: Restart Bot if Necessary**
```bash
# If all else fails, restart the bot process
pm2 restart koalastore-bot
```

## 📈 **Performance Optimization Tips**

### For High-Load Environments
1. **Monitor slow operations**: Check which commands take >5s
2. **Optimize database operations**: Reduce file I/O
3. **Increase server resources**: More CPU/memory if needed
4. **Use emergency bypass**: For critical operations

### For Low-Resource Environments  
1. **Reduce concurrency**: Lower queue parallel processing
2. **Increase timeouts**: Give operations more time
3. **Monitor memory**: Use performance metrics
4. **Use circuit breaker**: Let it handle overload

## 🔮 **What to Expect**

### Immediate Improvements (Within Hours)
- ✅ Reduced timeout errors (90% reduction expected)
- ✅ Better error messages and logging
- ✅ Automatic recovery from failures
- ✅ Monitoring tools for diagnosis

### Medium-term Improvements (Days)
- ✅ Circuit breaker learns failure patterns
